[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

include::{snippets}/deployment-not-found/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, a request that attempts to apply a not existing deployment will produce a
`404 Not Found` response:

include::{snippets}/deployment-not-found/http-response.adoc[]

[[overview-metadata]]
== Metadata

The Orchestrator adds hypermedia and pagination metadata in the responses.

=== Hypermedia
The Orchestrator uses hypermedia links (atom link) to other resources in the responses. Atom link element defines a reference 
from an entry or feed to a Web resource.
include::{snippets}/deployment-hypermedia/response-fields.adoc[]

Links to other resource:
include::{snippets}/deployment-hypermedia/links.adoc[]

When the response is paginated, the response can include also this links:
include::{snippets}/deployment-paged/links.adoc[]
