# HOW TO UPGRADE

The Orchestrator is released as Docker Container. In order to upgrade a deployed instance to a new version you have to:
 * if the instance is deployed on a orchestration solution (like Kubernetes), make reference on its guide on how to upgrade the instance to the new version
 * if the instance is deployed on a host with just a docker engine running:
  * Stop the old container:
  ```bash
  sudo docker stop orchestrator
  ```
  * Remove the old container:
  ```bash
  sudo docker rm orchestrator
  ```
  * Pull the new image version:
  ```bash
  sudo docker pull indigodatacloud/orchestrator:{TAG_OF_THE_VERSION}
  ```
  * Start the new version:
  ```bash
  sudo docker run --name orchestrator ...**parameters**... indigodatacloud/orchestrator:{TAG_OF_THE_VERSION}
  ```
